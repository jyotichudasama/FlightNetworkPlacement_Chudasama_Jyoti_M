*EXPLAINATION OF GAME*	

	Game is implemented using C++ programming,using Circular linked list. First i initialised all header files and array of a with max size 50(i.e max players can be 50). Structure of node with info and ptr of node is also defined.
	Starting from main,user has to enter no. of players(m,between 2-50 otherwise invalid),value for elimination(n,n<m) and 0 to exit. Then find_winner method is called in which 3 objects of node is created in which *start is the first node with info=1 and link to itself as it is circular,*add is to add other nodes with info incremented by 1 till condition is satisfied(i<=m) and *temp s used to traverse in list(it points to newly added node). Thus list is created.
	Now to eliminate one by one,temp is used that is point to start. elim_player method is called in which temp and n is passed.in this method node *pre is created for previous node. start travercing till count<n when you reached at nth position then link of pre to link of temp is set and info of temp is displayed,temp is shifted to next node and returned. this elimination is carried out untill cnt<m. if cnt=m,one player is remained so its a winner(displayed).
